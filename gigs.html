	and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990204020539/http://soils.ecn.purdue.edu/%7Edel/bruce/">Bruce</a>
	(ex-Fuzz Factor).
	There was Country&amp;Western techno, relative strangeness and a damn
	good time.

	<b>A Review</b>
	<blockquote>
	We were billed as <b>Linda McCartney On Tour</b>..
	We had a very quick set-up and level check before the
	hordes were allowed through the front gate.  Then we waited until
	our 11h30pm time-slot.  Even though this was the "chill-out" room,
	a surprising number of people stayed for the entire 50:58 performance,
	which I took as a good sign.  Bruce did his affected guitar bits
	to satisfaction, but we decided against his vocals on the
	<i>"Come On Baby, Let's Make Babies"</i> C&amp;W tune.  Overall, the
	vocals were too low in the mix, and the sound system was slightly
	underpowered.  But nobody threw anything, so chalk up a win for us.
	<p>
	Tapes are available from
	<a href="http://soils.ecn.purdue.edu/~del/bruce/moose.html">
	Moosetone Records</a>

	Special thanks to <a href="sharp.html">Matt Sharp</a> for
	allowing the use of two of his tunes.
