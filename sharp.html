	</center>
	<hr>
	The original Vergiftung was the brainchild of one Matt Sharp,
	alcoholic/musical genuis, and dates from the late 80's.
	<p>
	At the time he still attended Indiana University, and I had gone to
	a couple of Belgian Waffles
	shows in Bloomington, Indiana where Matt was a fixture as <i>
	that guy who made noise to piss people off</i>. I would take
	<a href="https://davidwhittemore.com/gallery/index.html">photos</a>
	and generally stand in corners.
	<p>
	Matt's music was not bad, in fact he had great "concepts" and contempt
	for whatever was popular (he still does).  This aspect of him
	is one reason we got along so well.
	<p>
	After Matt moved here to Purdue University, somehow we hooked up and
	started making noise.  At the time, I was a complete novice at actually
	making sound, although I had a great appreciation for it (it has
	something to do with <a href="http://www.davidwhittemore.com/gallery/trees.html">my
	background</a>, I guess).  About that time, I had played around
	some with a sampler belonging to John Davison, and I knew it was
	something that I could learn to love.
	<p>
	The earliest stuff that Matt and I emitted occurred right after I had
	picked up a Sony D3 DAT tape recorder.  Our first production,
	the 22 minute epic sound-collage
	<i>O Danny Boy</i>
	was a 4-track wonder, and would probably get us sued out of
	existance if it were ever commercially released.
	From the KLF to Elvis to disco and back, it is something I am
	still proud of.
	<p>
	Then I bought a sampler for myself, and for about a year and a half,
	Vergiftung was a spontaneous drunken phenomenon,
	and it is all documented - there are
	<b>hours</b>
	of it digitally preserved for anyone who is curious.
	<p>
	Apparently, conflict-of-females came into the picture, I discovered
	some sense of quality control,
	<a href="./images/brady.jpg">Brady</a> started
	coming 'round my apartment, and Matt began to loose interest in what I
	was churning out.  Our last live show together was at The Lower Links
	in Chicago in December,
	1992 - it was a nice slide show, and the people seated on the
	dank floor at least clapped once.  Everyone (including those on-stage)
	were perplexed.  In the audience was a friend whom I know through
	<a href="https://jazzbutcher.com/index.html"> the Jazz Butcher</a>, one
	<a href="https://jazzbutcher.com/conspirators/martin_stebbing.html">Martin Stebbing</a>
	who happened to be a recording engineer with a perverse sense
	of taste. Within the month, Vergiftung were in the studio, sans Sharp.
	<p>
	With Matt decidedly retreated into the bars, the Whittemore/Brady Branam
	alliance became one of necessity - I had things to express, and although
	I wished Matt to be involved, I didn't let it stop me.
	<p>
	With Matt no longer interested in making music, I continued on with what
	I was doing under the Vergiftung name.
	This is what you find here.
	<p>
	<b>Epilogue</b>
	<p>
	Matt is soon to attend graduate school, either at MIT, or in
	Chapel Hill.  He has played around some with music some since,
	adding beats where his unique style is requested.  I wish him the
	best with everything, and without him, none of this would
	have been possible.
	<p>
	Thank you Matt.

		I had not remembered that Vergiftung lasted beyond the IU years, once I decipher downloading sound on this computer, I will enjoy listening.  Matt is a mad &#34;scientist&#34;.  Soon, his slower and younger brother shall record...they are hardly related.
