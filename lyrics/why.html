	Why<br>
	Why<br>
	Why'd you have to go?<br>
	Why<br>
	Was<br>
	I the last to know?<br>
	I don't know how I'm living.<br>
	I don't know who you're giving to..<br>
<br>
	It seems I just got here - It could have been years.<br>
	It's been a long time.<br>
	It seems I just got here - It could just be days.<br>
	When will you go away?<br>
<br>
	Why<br>
	Why'd you have to go?<br>
	Why<br>
	Was<br>
	I the last to know?<br>
	I don't know how I'm living.<br>
	I don't know who you're giving to<br>
	These days.<br>
<br>
	I don't care anymore - You walked out on me.<br>
	I don't care anymore.<br>
	I don't know anymore - Just where I'm going.<br>
	When I close the door.<br>
<br>
	Why<br>
	Why'd you have to go?<br>
	Why<br>
	Was<br>
	I the last to know?<br>
	I don't know how I'm living.<br>
	I don't know who you're giving to<br>
	These days.<br>
	These days.<br>
	These days.<br>
	These days.
