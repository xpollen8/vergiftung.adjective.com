	<br>Brady and I shared a really shitty apartment one summer.
	I slept on the couch, and we refused to ever take the trash out.
	One evening, on a walk to get more Lucky Strikes, Brady found
	a Sears acoustic guitar in a dumpster.  I hated that place.
	<br>Only after reading
	Douglas Adam's <i>Mostly Harmless</i> did I begin to understand this song.

	I once had a brain<br>
	Then I got lucky.<br>
	I wouldn't call it luck now.<br>
<br>
	I'm looking for the last chance breakfast bar.<br>
	Has anyone seen my car<br>
	No resistance<br>
	I can only see so far<br>
<br>
	The pancake I'm in love with<br>
	Is the one before the last one, baby.<br>
	Honey scarred and periphery lighting<br>
	Condiments for the planned in-fighting<br>
	I'm hanging out.<br>
	Bits are falling onto the linoleum.<br>
	It's easy to clean<br>
	But I can't puzzle out where the pieces fit the dream<br>
<br>
	The pantry's bare<br>
	Lee there - he holds a mayonnaise.<br>
	I won't tell him I left it out<br>
	He doesn't know that's what it's about.<br>
<br>
	I'm watching luge bowling<br>
	Lottery programs: too embarrassing.<br>
	Reading in bed<br>
	Afternoon drinking<br>
<br>
	It's harder though when I stopped thinking<br>
<br>
	The pancake I'm in love with<br>
	Is the one before the last one, baby.<br>
	Honey scared and periphery lighting<br>
	Condiments for the planned in-fighting<br>
	I'm hanging out.<br>
	Bits are falling onto the linoleum.<br>
	It's easy to clean<br>
	But I can't puzzle out where the pieces fit the dream
