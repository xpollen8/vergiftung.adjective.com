	One afternoon a couple of summers ago, I attended the annual
	Omelette and Daiquiri Summit hosted by
	Dennis Hilgenberg and
	John Davison
	where quite a bit of hardcore techno was playing.
	I thought that perhaps that stuff wasn't too difficult to program,
	so I went home and tossed this thing off.
	It shows its age in places, but there are plenty of changes to
	keep it interesting.
