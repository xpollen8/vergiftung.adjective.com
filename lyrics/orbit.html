	<br>Features A <b>Real Drummer!</b>:
	Chris Brick, Battery Studio recording tech - for $20!
	You will find his name (and
	<a href="https://jazzbutcher.com/conspirators/martin_stebbing.html">Martin's</a>)
	on the back of the Will Smith (The Fresh Prince) single of
	<i>Boom! Boom! Shake The Room</i>.
	<br>Bass samples constructed from a vocal introduction taken
	from live set by folk artist <b>Carrie Newcomer</b>
	(her latest album album is on Rounder Records - buy it!)
	<p>
	This was probably my very first song with a traditional verse,
	chorus, verse, chorus, verse arrangement, and it happened
	completely by accident; at the time I didn't really pay attention
	what differentiated a verse from a chorus.
	But my adopted boy genius was egging me on, so I kept with it until
	the words finally presented themselves.  Along the Vergiftung time-line,
	this is about when the mad-in-intensity
	<a href="../sharp.html">Sharp</a>/Whittemore line-up became the
	mad-about-melody Whittemore/Branam line-up.
	Basically, this is where we stopped being chaos, whether that
	be good or whether that be bad.
	<p>
	There are 5 melodies fighting it out during the chorus.
	<p>
	Oh yeah, lyrics.... as <a href="https://jazzbutcher.com">Pat Fish</a>
	would say: "<i>Whaddya want, a diagram?</i>"

	Her hair went from blonde to brown,<br>
	My eyes from brown to green.<br>
	In a downpour I was taken,<br>
	By the bluest eyes I'd ever seen.<br>
<br>
	I know that wanting love is simply not enough,<br>
	But living lost in her eyes is where I'm caught.<br>
<br>
	Coz we went spinning,<br>
	I was taken,<br>
	Drawn by her gravity<br>
<br>
	Well I never thought<br>
	After all the love and talks<br>
	That I'd never<br>
	That I'd never<br>
	That I'd never see her again<br>
<br>
	What had happened happens over and over:<br>
	This selfish notion to share love with another<br>
	Always ends in carpet-eating misery<br>
	Its a mystery.<br>
	Why she said that I could not talk,<br>
	I say she did not care.<br>
<br>
	Well I never thought<br>
	After all the PAIN and talks<br>
	That I'd never<br>
	That I'd never<br>
	That I'd never see her again<br>
<br>
	Won't you tell her that I need her love tonight<br>
	Won't you tell me where my love has gone tonight<br>
	Won't you tell her that I need her love tonight<br>
	I only ever tried to please her<br>
	Now she's under anesthesia<br>
<br>
	Still..
