	<br>Whales from <i>Songs Of The Humpback Whale</i>,
		Living Music, LD0021.
	<p>
	This song is about 32 years old now;
	it was inspired in part by
	the <b>Hypnotone</b> album <i>Ai</i> (Creation Records, 1991).
	Versions of Whale have been done in the studio
	with real mics and everything, but this version is one of the earliest
	we ever did (mastered to cassette, shamefully) simply because the guitar
	sounds we got from <b>the black box</b> were just too beautiful and
	un-reproducable in the studio.
	<p>
	Sure, its disco, but i love how
	it takes 3 minutes to build up and the release at the end is (to me)
	very emotional for a front-room recording.

	Smoke screams through a silent movie<br>
	Cold and silver night.<br>
	Her hands touch soundlessly<br>
	Like these distant dancing lights.<br>
	This is as close<br>
	Shapes in empty waters sink.<br>
	Her surest breathing hides<br>
	More than shadows in her eyes.<br>
<br>
	Our last grey leaving hour.<br>
	The colours hold their stare.<br>
	No light reveiling<br>
	No curtains conceding.<br>
	Could you disappear<br>
	If you were never really here?
