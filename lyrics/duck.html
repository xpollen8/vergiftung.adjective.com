	<p>
	Brady likes a challenge - you write something in a strange 6/8
	with a single bar break of 32nd note kick drums, and he <b>still</b>
	manages a lyrics.
	<p>
	This is actually a really sad song.  I wrote it the night.....
	Well, let me start at the beginning.
	I work late.  The summer of '93, when I would go outside, there
	was a very large toad who would sit on the sidewalk under the light.
	He was my pet, he was my friend.
	<p>
	One night, it was starting to storm, so i decided to take a look
	outside, <i>as I opened the door, looked up to the sky, and
	<b>stepped</b> outside...</i>  <blink>*Crunch*</blink>, he went.
	<p>
	Somewhere along the line, <i>toad</i> permuted into <i>duck</i>
	(don't ask), and this is my obscure tribute to my dear, dear,
	dead friend.

	I'm damaged, the weather looks the same.<br>
	Evening rain and morning coffee,<br>
	Don't leave a stain mixing down the drain.<br>
	Under the strain of living, everybody's feeling fine -<br>
	I'll stay in bed.<br>
	The train works but we've no power.<br>
	Hoisery that's sliding, luggage lost in time.<br>
	At the very least that's where I'm found.<br>
	It's crowded here land-locked midland town.<br>
	Yo-ho<br>
	Yo-ho<br>
	Yo-ho<br>
	Yo-ho!<br>
	I'm seeing ducks...<br>
	Has it gone that far?<br>
	They don't give a fuck.<br>
	Chunking in their favourite...<br>
	Bar.
