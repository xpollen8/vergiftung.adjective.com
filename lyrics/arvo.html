	Samples from <b>Arvo P&auml;rt's</b> <i>Miserere</i>,
	ECM New Series 1430.
	<br>This is what can happen when two people, a guitar, a CD player,
	The Might Casio SK1, a cassette tape of <a
	href="../images/alex.gif">a friend</a>
	walking through Vienna and Dortmunder Union beer meet late at night.
	When people ask <i>"what <b>is</b> Vergiftung all about"</i>, Brady and
	I play stuff like this for them.
	<p>
	If you haven't noticed by now, Vergiftung flirts with the "pop" side
	of things, but music like <b>Arvo Party</b> is our roots, and it is
	what we would like to do more of - working with sequencers is a bit
	of a curse in that once a drum line, or anything else is in the
	machine, the song structure is pretty much fixed.
	<a href="../sharp.html">Here is the
	ancient history of Vergiftung</a>.
	<p>
	Occasionally, we start something new with no idea where it will end
	and just do it.  The results are usually rewarding.
	<p>
	However, when people ask <a href="../gigs.html"><i>"when
	are you playing live again"</i></a>, we have a bit of a problem.
	You see, people at concerts <b>expect</b> a drummer.
	Seeing how we have only used a real drummer on one tune so far
	(<a href="orbit.html"><b>Orbit</b></a>), this
	leaves 2 (or 3) guys standing onstage appearing naked to the expecting
	audience.  (the last time we played, we covered some BIG boxes with
	wrapping paper to be placed onstage - get it?  <i>stage presents?</i>)
	<p>
	Add to it that we would like to present people with more "difficult"
	music like <b>Arvo Party</b> and have them not throw stuff at us and
	you can see our dilemma.
	<p>
	What is Vergiftung?  All you find here and more.  We are capable of
	much, and have considerable contempt for run-of-the-mill,
	well, you know.  Radioland.  That place.  Good for a laugh but
	not much more.  What're 3 to do in the face of it all?
	Alex Chilton is near-death.
	<p>
	Give up?
	<p>
	Hell no.
