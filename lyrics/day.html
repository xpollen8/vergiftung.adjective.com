	I was driving on route 1,<br>
		it was the first road that I could find.<br>
	Is it enough to think of you, or do I have to be there too?<br>
<br>
	I won't be there tomorrow; I'm too far gone.<br>
	I always know just what to do<br>
		but I never seem to be able to.<br>
<br>
	In the rearview: detours, sunsets;<br>
	I can't find that map to love<br>
	Leaving postcard twilight miles behind<br>
	In towns I've never heard of<br>
<br>
	I won't be there tomorrow; I'm too far gone.<br>
	I always know just what to do but<br>
		I never seem to be able to.<br>
	Not able to...<br>
<br>
	jessica: [Come on, I don't believe it,<br>
		you left me here last night!<br>
		Drunk, alone, with people that<br>
		I don't like as much as you..<br>
		So what happened?]<br>
<br>
	I was driving on route 1,<br>
		it was the first escape I could find.<br>
	Now I need the windows down,<br>
		I've got to get away from this town.<br>
<br>
	I won't be there tomorrow; I'm too far gone.<br>
	Now I need the windows down,<br>
		but I can't get those damned windows down.<br>
<br>
	I need the windows down.
