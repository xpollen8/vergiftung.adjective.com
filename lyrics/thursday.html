	Hmmm.  This is a case of Brady crucifying what once was an instrumental
	built out of Thelonius Monk samples and a catchy 10-bar bassline.
	<p>
	The first line explains the title.  Maybe.

	There's a girl named Friday I never see.<br>
	Only home one night a week<br>
	Thankfully message machines<br>
	20 seconds is all to be quickly sincere.<br>
	Her cats are bored alone<br>
	Erasing all they hear<br>
	What's she selling on nights like bliss?<br>
	An olive moon is rising too far away to kiss<br>
	It's pathetic<br>
	It's an awful mess<br>
	To begin the day on the wrong foot<br>
	In the wrong color dress<br>
	How's she to know?<br>
	How desparately thirsting<br>
	The game is televised<br>
	There's no hope for thursday<br>
	Where does she move<br>
	The same space everyday<br>
	Heard about tomorrow<br>
	But thursday's here to stay<br>
	Thursday's here to stay
